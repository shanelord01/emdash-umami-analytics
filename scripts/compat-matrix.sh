# Run the plugin's suite against a list of EmDash versions and print which
# combinations pass.
#
# Why this exists: `@emdash-cms/plugin-test` pins `emdash` exactly (0.2.6 pins
# 1.0.1), so out of the box a plugin is only ever tested against the one host
# version the harness chose. pnpm `overrides` rewire the harness's own pinned
# dependency, which is how a range becomes testable at all.
#
# That is a workaround, not a supported path. Nothing stops a future plugin-test
# from importing a symbol that exists only in its pinned host, and the failure
# would look like a plugin bug. The baseline row (no overrides) is therefore not
# optional: it is what tells a harness breakage apart from a plugin regression.
#
# The reverse happened with EmDash 1.0: it moved the module the harness loads
# (`emdash/plugin-test-runtime` became `emdash/internal/plugin-test-runtime`),
# so no harness before plugin-test 0.2.6 can start a 1.0 host. A version
# written as `version:harness` also overrides plugin-test, for example
# `1.0.1:0.2.6`.
#
# `--no-baseline` skips the baseline row, for CI jobs that each run one
# version while a separate job runs the suites on their pinned host.
#
# Usage: scripts/compat-matrix.sh [--no-baseline] [version[:harness]...]      (default: 1.0.1)
